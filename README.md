Flask-RestPlus Leave Demo
=========================
RESTful API Server Example
--------------------------

This project showcases my my scratchpad for building a demo RESTful server
with python and flask-restplus

The goals set for this example:

* RESTful API server should be self-documented using OpenAPI (fka Swagger)
  specifications, so interactive documentation UI is in place;
* Authentication is handled with Basic Auth and rudimentary roles queries.
  This can later be swapped out for OAuth2
* Request Args validation
* Testing with pytest
* Usage of SQLite
* Code migrations and code first models
* Dockerization
